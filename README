README anime_csv on Linux

anime_csv is a python script that takes 1449 csv values and writes them directly
to the anime_matrix on an Asus G14 2022 model (GA402RK). It does not depend 
on asusctl or other service daemon.

Why csv?

Other software from Asus or asusctl can translate and display from gif or png
images. By supplying 1449 brightness values in csv form, we directly specify
the brightness of each LED. Also, since the csv reader ignores whitespace,
we can format the csv file to look exactly like the matrix itself, greatly
simplifying the pixel perfect drawing of images. The provided examples show 
nicely formatted csv files. As a final benefit, editing a csv file in something 
like vi makes it really easy to do things like set all the leds, or all the 
edges at once. Besides, who doesn't want to edit led pixels directly in vi?

The matrix has 1449 leds in an odd format - 61 rows high by 34 columns wide,
but with rows offset in a diamond pattern, and with the bottom left corner
of the matrix missing. Normally it is hard to control a specific LED directly,
but with the formatted csv template it becomes simple.

Running (as root):

First, if you have asusctl installed (you probably do), turn it off with a:
    systemctl stop asusd
    
Then simply:
    ./anime_csv <csv file name>

template.csv provides an example with all edges of the matrix on full.
dave.csv has all background pixels on dim, the edges on medium, and the
word "DAVE" in bright.

While editing the csv files, keep each numeric field 3 characters wide with
a trailing comma and space to keep the proportions correct. (e.g. "  1, ",
or "255, "). Values must be 0 - 255 inclusive, 0 being off and 255 full.
Also, you will want to expand the window large enough to avoid line wrap.

A wireshark usb capture of the data sent to the matrix device is included
in binary (pcapng) format and as fully parsed in a pdf, so you can follow
along with the source code to understand how the code works.
